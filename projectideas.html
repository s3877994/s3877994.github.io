  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. VPN helps users send and receive data over the internet in a safer way by encrypting the connection. VPN also helps you hide your IP address which makes it untraceable.</p>
  <h2>Motivation</h2> 
  <p>Whenever you use your Wi-Fi network, your IP address can be recorded by your internet service provider. Your IP address can reveal information about your location. For example, when I try to look up to buy something on the internet, I will automatically share that information to the internet provider and start receiving many targeted ads. Also when using public Wi-Fi hotspots, all of your data is sent unencrypted to the router, meaning anyone in who using the same Wi-Fi network can see your data: like passwords and the website you are accessing to. When you travel outside your country, there is some service or app that can only be available in your country. All of these problem can be fixed by using VPN.</p>
  <h2>Description </h2>
  <p>When you open the VPN app, select the country you want to connect to. VPN will create a data tunnel between your network to the country that you selected. VPN will make the data encrypted and unreadable. All of the data that your internet uses will pass through this encrypted channel before connecting to the public Internet. All the data coming from the tunnel will appear as a VPN’s IP address not from your IP address. By doing that, it’ll appear to others that you connect to the network from a place that can be a thousand miles away from your location. By using VPN, all of your IP address and location will not be revealed to others. It will also help you connect to a website that is not available in your location. It will appear to the local location that you connected from your home country.  For example, in China, Facebook, Google, YouTube, and many other apps were blocked by the government which can make many tourists uncomfortable. By using VPN, tourists can access all the websites that they want in China. Even if you are a Vietnamese citizen, but you are traveling in a country other than Vietnam and you want to access to Vietnamese Netflix, it’s not possible without using a VPN. Several online services charge differently depending on your location so VPN also reduces the cost when you go online shopping. You can buy cheaper items by connecting via a VPN so that the online service provider doesn’t know you connect from that location. By using a VPN, you can hide all of your browsing history and IP address which can make your privacy at risk. Web browsers and internet providers can track the user’s browsing history and tie it to the IP address. Whenever you connect to a web server, that server will know your IP address as well as your location. When you use a public Wi-Fi network like a shopping mall, coffee shop... to check your bank account, sending mail, paying bills, buying stuff online... cyber criminals can easily capture your credit card number and log-in credentials by using the same network. Cybercriminals can do a lot of things when they steal your identity and information. They can commit a crime in your name or steal your money.</p>
  <h2>Tools and Technologies </h2>
  <p>In order to create a VPN app, I need to use a managed cloud services platform like Amazon EC2.It will help me with infrastructure management. I also need to find an API solution to expedite the process. An API solution that can be used is: PureVPN. I also need a test automation aid that can help me test a wide range of devices which can make sure that my VPN can work well on all the devices. I will need to develop a website to market the VPN. I also need to design a IOS app and Android app. I also need to build the app on Chrome extension.</p>
  <h2>Skills Required </h2>
  <p>To build a VPN software, I need to learn more about developing the website using html, css and JavaScript skill. I also need to study more about API solutions. I also need to develop and publish the VPN extension to Chrome web store. In order to build the IOS app, I need to learn Objective-C, a programming language that can code the app. In order to create an Android app, I need Java and Android Studio. Both of these platforms also need to use pCloudy to test the app. I need to integrate the API for PureVPN with the app.</p>
  <h2>Outcome</h2>
  <p>VPN can make the data encrypted make your IP address and your location hidden. VPN can help you hide your browsing activities for more security. VPN also help you unlock geo-location restricted content</p>
