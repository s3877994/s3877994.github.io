<h2>Cybersecurity and privacy</h2>
<h3>What does it do?</h3>
<p>With the rapid growth of the internet, threats of insecurity are also widespread. Cybersecurity will protect computers, networks, programs, or data from threats like: phishing, ransomware, malware, ... As more and more transactions go through online banking, e-wallets, debit cards and credit cards, cybersecurity will become important. In particular, vulnerabilities in applications, operating systems, and online communication platforms are particularly common dangers of today's cybersecurity. By using the VPN constantly, it also helps boost cybersecurity. By hiding the user IP address and geographical location, VPN can help users and businesses improve security for targeted cyber-attacks.</p>
<h3>What is the likely impact? </h3> 
<p>No company or country is safe from a cyberattack. Every company, whether it has big or small business  has vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers. However, the main reason behind a company being hacked is not the existence of danger, hackers, but by how much concern of the company leader’s toward cybersecurity. Especially in small businesses, they think that they are too small to be a target for hackers. In most companies they have a database that records credit card information and hackers can easily steal the money. For example, Target US in 2013 confirmed  about 40 million credit and debit card accounts may have been unauthorized access due to many cybersecurity problems in third party company. Not only the employee of the company can be targeted but also the company’s leader. The CEO of the company gets all the access to the company’s data.To avoid this situation, all the employees and CEO of the company need to realize the importance of cybersecurity in business.</p>
<h3>How will this affect you? </h3>
<p>I usually use a virus scanner like: Kaspersky and Avast every month. All of my devices in my family connect to VPN.</p>
<h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
<h3>What does it do?</h3>
<p>Cloud computing is software, services, hardware, ...  located in virtual servers (cloud) on the network. Just by connecting to the internet system, users can access any resource in the cloud that they stored the data in. There are four popular types of cloud computing: Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud and Community Cloud.  Public Cloud is the most popular. Services and applications on Public Cloud are all on the same Cloud system which means that all the users will use the same resource. Private Cloud is usually used by the business to protect their own data. Private Cloud will protect from the inside of the firewall of the company. Hybrid Cloud is a combination of the Public Cloud and Private Cloud. Community Cloud infrastructure is shared between several organizations from a specific community with common concern. There are 3 types of cloud computing service: infrastructure as a service (Iaas), Platform as a service (Paas), Software as a service (Saas). Infrastructure as a service is a pay-per-use model. It will cost how much resource that the customer uses. Platform as a service is a service that developers mostly use. Platform as a service is almost the same with infrastructure as a service but it is a higher level. This platform uses BI, middleware...Software as a service is the most popular. It allows users to use applications easily on the cloud platform by the internet and everyone can use it. Microsoft Office 365, One Drive, Dropbox, ...  also use Software as a service. In the near future, nearly all businesses will operate primarily in cloud computing because of its cost effectiveness, productivity, and flexibility that this service platform offers</p>
<h3>What is the likely impact? </h3> 
<p>Cloud computing can save a lot of cost. With cloud computing, investment costs for infrastructure deployment are minimized, costs of buying hardware, software, maintenance, installation costs, and labor costs are also significantly reduced. It is also convenient because with your data, you can access them anytime, anywhere, virtually independent of software or hardware. With Dropbox, Gmail or google Docs, you only need to have the Internet, you can completely access the desired data. Cloud computing is safe because: Data located on Dropbox or similar will be much more secure. Although it is not absolutely safe because there are still risks, it is still much higher than traditional storage methods. Your data will still be in your online account, so losing your storage devices is not a concern because no one will be able to retrieve your data without a password.</p>
<h3>How will this affect you? </h3>
<p>Before, whenever you want to store data, I have to buy a hard drive. And if for some reason, the hard drive broke, I have to buy a new one. Hard drives also can lose data. Nowadays, by the use of cloud computing, every time I want to store the data, I can use Google Drive which allows me to have all the data that I need just by connecting to the internet. I usually buy a new IPhone every year. Without cloud computing, I have to manually send the photos, information contact, apps, and many other data from my old phone to the new one. Now just by log in to the ICloud, all the data in my old phone can transform to my new phone. I also don’t have worry when lost my phone because of all the data have been upload to the ICloud. I use Google docs all the time. When I go to school, I take notes on Google docs and don’t have to bring a notebook. </p>
